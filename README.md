The K-GSPOOFER is a program that changes the MachineGuid and HwidProfile values in the Windows registry.
By changing these values, **you will get back the free trials** in most of the shareware programs. Previously this type of programs used to avoid bans in videogames but now the actual videogames use stronger bans (not only the HWID and GUID).
